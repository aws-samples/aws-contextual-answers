# Generative AI-Powered Clinical Intelligence

This repository contains code examples and utilities for leveraging AI21's Contextual Answers technology on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to unlock insights from unstructured clinical data, such as physician's notes and patient records.

## Overview

The code demonstrates how to deploy and use AI21's Contextual Answers, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model, to answer natural language questions based on provided clinical text data. This approach allows healthcare organizations to safely and responsibly gain insights from unstructured patient information while mitigating risks like data hallucination.

## Features

- Deploy AI21's Contextual Answers model on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
- Query the model with natural language questions
- Receive summarized responses based on relevant information from the provided clinical text data
- Strict guardrails to ensure responses are backed by evidence in the text, reducing the risk of hallucinations

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- AWS account
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python packages (e.g., boto3, sagemaker, ai21)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/generative-ai-clinical-intelligence.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Set up your AWS credentials and configure the necessary permissions.
2. Prepare your clinical text data (e.g., physician's notes, patient records) in a suitable format.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to deploy the AI21 Contextual Answers model on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.
4. Use the provided functions to query the model with natural language questions related to your clinical text data.
5. Analyze the summarized responses generated by the model, which will be based on relevant information from the provided text data.

## Examples

The repository includes example Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate how to use the AI21 Contextual Answers model for various healthcare use cases, such as accelerating research, improving clinical decision support, and enhancing patient profiling from medical history.
